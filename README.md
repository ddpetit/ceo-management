# CEO Personal Operating System

A private, single-user productivity system designed for clarity, not complexity.

This is not software. It's a thinking system — a collection of prompts, frameworks, and rituals that help you reflect, decide, and move forward with intention.

---

## What This System Does

- **Daily**: Grounds you in 5 minutes. Energy, wins, friction, letting go, tomorrow's priority.
- **Weekly**: Surfaces what mattered vs. what was noise. One adjustment.
- **Quarterly**: Checks goal alignment. Catches drift before it compounds.
- **Annually**: Deep reflection on the year behind. Clear intention for the year ahead.

It also helps you:
- Process past reviews and notes to find patterns in your thinking
- Run guided self-interviews to surface what you already know but haven't articulated
- Design your ideal future using proven frameworks
- Maintain a living memory of insights that compounds over time

## Uploading Past Documents

If you have past annual reviews, performance feedback, journal entries, or notes:

1. Place them in `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`
2. Ask Claude to summarize and extract patterns
3. Claude will identify:
   - Recurring goals (what you keep saying you'll do)
   - Repeated failures (what keeps not happening)
   - Consistent strengths (what you're reliably good at)
   - Blind spots (what you avoid mentioning)
   - Emotional themes (what triggers energy or drain)
4. These patterns get synthesized into `memory.md`
5. Future check-ins reference these patterns for accountability

---

## Personalization

This system uses placeholders you should replace:

- `[YOUR COMPANY]` — Your primary business or organization
- `[YOUR ROLE]` — How you describe your position
- `[YOUR STAGE OF LIFE]` — Early career, mid-career, pre-exit, post-exit, etc.
- `[YOUR CURRENT PRIORITIES]` — The 2-3 things that matter most right now

Find and replace these throughout the system to make it yours.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity over complexity** — If it feels like overhead, simplify it
2. **Reflection over tracking** — This is about insight, not metrics
3. **Honesty over performance** — No one sees this but you
4. **Patterns over incidents** — Look for what repeats
5. **Energy over time** — Manage your capacity, not just your calendar

---

## Credits

This system draws from the work of:

- **Dr. Anthony Gustin** — Annual Review framework
- **Tim Ferriss** — Ideal Lifestyle Costing
- **Tony Robbins** — Vivid Vision thinking
- **Alex Lieberman** — Life Map (six domains)

These frameworks are adapted, not copied. Use what resonates. Discard what doesn't.

---

## A Note on Tone

This system is designed to feel like:
- A thoughtful executive coach
- A sharp chief of staff
- A reflective mirror
- A gentle accountability partner

It should be calm, direct, insightful, and psychologically safe.

No hustle culture. No therapy speak. No corporate jargon. No productivity theater.

Just you, thinking clearly about what matters.

---

## Getting Help

This entire system runs on plain text files. You can:
- Edit everything in any text editor
- Search across all files instantly
- Back up to any cloud service
- Version control with git if you want history

If you use Claude Code, you can ask it to:
- Process your uploads and extract patterns
- Run you through an interview
- Generate a fresh daily/weekly/quarterly/annual template
- Synthesize your memory file with new insights
- Challenge your thinking on a specific decision

Start with `north_star.md`. The rest follows from there.
