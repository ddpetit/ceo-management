# Annual Review Framework

*Adapted from Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review approach*

---

## What This Is

An annual review is a structured way to look back at your year — what happened, what you learned, and what it means for next year. It's not a performance review. No one is grading you. It's a conversation with yourself about what's true.

Dr. Anthony Gustin's framework emphasizes honest reflection over goal-tracking. The point isn't to measure yourself against targets. It's to understand yourself better so you can make wiser choices going forward.

**Time required**: 2-4 hours
**When to do it**: Late December or early January
**What you'll need**: This template, your calendar from the past year, any notes or journals
