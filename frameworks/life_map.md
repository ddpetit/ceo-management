# Life Map

*Adapted from Alex Lieberman's Six Domains framework*

---

## What This Is

Your life is not just your work. It's not just your relationships. It's not just your health. It's the integration of multiple domains, each influencing the others.

Alex Lieberman's Life Map divides life into six interconnected domains: **Career, Relationships, Health, Meaning, Finances, and Fun**. Neglecting any domain eventually undermines the others. Overinvesting in one domain often comes at a hidden cost to the rest.

This framework helps you audit where you are, identify imbalances, and intentionally design across all domains — not just the loudest one.

**The key insight**: Most people optimize obsessively for one or two domains (usually Career and Finances) while the others atrophy. The Life Map forces you to see the whole picture and make conscious trade-offs.

**Time required**: 60 minutes for initial mapping, 30 minutes for updates
**When to do it**: Annually, or when something feels off but you can't name it
**What you'll need**: Honesty, willingness to look at what you've neglected

## The Six Domains

### 1. Career
*Your work, professional identity, and contribution through vocation*

What you do for money, influence, or impact. Includes your role, your company, your industry, your professional reputation, your skills, and your trajectory.

**Key question**: Is my work meaningful, sustainable, and aligned with who I want to be?

### 2. Relationships
*The people in your life — intimate, familial, social, professional*

Your partner, family, friends, colleagues, community. The quality and depth of your connections. Who you spend time with and how those relationships make you feel.

**Key question**: Am I surrounded by people who make me better, and am I showing up for them?

### 3. Health
*Your physical body, mental state, and overall vitality*

Physical fitness, nutrition, sleep, energy, mental health, stress management. The foundation that makes everything else possible.

**Key question**: Is my body and mind a source of strength or a source of limitation?

### 4. Meaning
*Your sense of purpose, values, and connection to something larger*

What gives your life significance. Could be spiritual, philosophical, creative, or service-oriented. The "why" behind your "what."

**Key question**: Do I know why I'm here and what I'm trying to contribute?

### 5. Finances
*Your relationship with money — earning, saving, spending, security*

Income, wealth, security, freedom. Not just the numbers, but how you feel about money and whether it's a source of freedom or stress.

**Key question**: Does my financial situation give me options and peace of mind?

### 6. Fun
*Play, adventure, joy, creativity, and things you do for their own sake*

The domain most adults abandon. Hobbies, adventures, spontaneity, laughter, creativity. Things you do not for achievement but for enjoyment.

**Key question**: When did I last do something purely for the joy of it?
