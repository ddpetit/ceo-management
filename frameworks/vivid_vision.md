# Vivid Vision

*Inspired by Tony Robbins's approach to future-state visualization*

---

## What This Is

A Vivid Vision is a detailed description of your life at a specific point in the future — written as if it has already happened. It's not a goal list. It's not a strategic plan. It's a sensory, emotional, concrete picture of what your life looks like when things have gone well.

The power of this exercise is in the specificity. Vague visions produce vague results. Detailed visions create clarity about what you're actually working toward — and help you recognize opportunities that align with that future.

**The key insight**: Your brain doesn't distinguish well between a vividly imagined future and a remembered past. When you write your vision in present tense with rich detail, you create a kind of memory of the future that influences your decisions and attention.

**Time required**: 60-90 minutes
**When to do it**: Annually, or when you feel lost about direction
**What you'll need**: Uninterrupted time, honesty, permission to dream

## Instructions

1. **Choose your time horizon**: Pick a date 3 years from now. Not next year (too tactical), not 10 years (too abstract). Three years is far enough to allow real change, close enough to feel tangible.

2. **Write in present tense**: "I am..." not "I will..." You're describing reality as of that future date.

3. **Include sensory details**: What do you see, hear, feel? Where are you? What does the morning look like? How does your body feel?

4. **Don't censor**: This is for you. No one is evaluating whether it's realistic. First, capture what you actually want. Feasibility comes later.

5. **Cover all domains**: Work through each life area systematically.
