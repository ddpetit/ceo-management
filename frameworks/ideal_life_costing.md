# Ideal Lifestyle Costing

*Adapted from Tim Ferriss's approach in The 4-Hour Workweek*

---

## What This Is

Most people have never calculated what their ideal life actually costs. They assume it's "more" — more than they have, more than they can imagine, more than is realistic. But "more" is not a number. And vague financial targets lead to vague effort.

This framework helps you calculate the specific dollar amount required to live your ideal life. The answer is usually less than you think — and knowing the real number changes everything.

**The key insight**: Your goal isn't "wealth" or "financial freedom" — abstract concepts that can never be achieved. Your goal is a specific monthly number that funds the life you actually want. Once you know that number, you can work backward to create it.

**Time required**: 60-90 minutes
**When to do it**: Annually, or when your lifestyle goals shift
**What you'll need**: Honesty about what you actually want, a calculator
