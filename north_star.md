## Current Context

**Name**: Damien PETITJEAN

**Date**: 01/01/2026

**Role**: 
CEO of PETITJEAN
Managing Partner at WEMEDIA

**Company/Organization**: 
PETITJEAN - We sell DIY, industrial supplies, garden machinery and tractors with 4 stores, 45 employees. Jobs are : in store sales representative, field sales representatives and technicians. Some of my in store sales representative are specialized in spare parts. Clients are farmers, factories, cities and B2C. We do 8M€ turnover.

WEMEDIA - We build web and mobile apps as a SaaS. We're 3 associates : Ludivine (CEO), Kaouthar and me. Ludivine is good at general thinking, Kaouthar is good at designing and communicating and me at computer science. We struggle at distribution. We don't want employees on WEMEDIA, but we accept working with freelancers.
WEMEDIA has currently many projects running : 
- CompareMandataire : price comparison tool for new cars
- Comparateur-Mandataires : same as CompareMandataire, but presented differently to the customers. Clients are the same (car brokers) and we sell them leads. MRR : 300€/month.
- Zagrow : a marketplace for used tractors. Clients are agricultural dealers like PETITJEAN. We have between 100 and 300 visitors daily. We're struggling to make dealers pay for the service. MRR : 0€/month
- Supernestor : an mobile app to make customized training inside companies. Currently we're launching the project, no customer yet. Trying to find product market fit.

**Stage of Life**: 
I would like to sell PETITJEAN and concentrate on WEMEDIA as I see a bigger opportunity.

**Years in current role**: 
PETITJEAN : 10 years
WEMEDIA : 2 years

**Team size you're responsible for**:
PETITJEAN : all the employees (45)
WEMEDIA : As we're all associates, we choose what we work on with our strengths and what we love to do.

## The One Thing

## Current Priorities

What are the 2-3 things that matter most right now? Not everything that's important — just the vital few.

1. Introduce performance based compensation for PETITJEAN employees
2. Increase organizational autonomy by reducing reliance on me (I'm currently the bottleneck on both companies)
3. Become more effective at distribution on WEMEDIA, we need to make at least 10.000€/month.
