# Identity & Values Interview

A guided self-interview to clarify who you are and what you stand for.

---

## How to Use This

This interview explores your core identity — who you are beneath the roles, titles, and responsibilities. It's deeper than strategy. It's about the person doing the strategizing.

Run through this when:
- You feel lost or disconnected from yourself
- You're facing a major life decision
- You want to reconnect with your core after a period of drift
- You're onboarding yourself into a new chapter of life

**Time needed**: 60-90 minutes
**Best environment**: Solitude, without time pressure
**Mindset**: Reflective, exploratory, honest
