# Past Year Reflection Interview

A guided self-interview to process the year behind you.

---

## How to Use This

This is a self-guided interview. Read each question, sit with it, then write your honest answer. Don't rush. Don't perform. No one sees this but you.

**Time needed**: 60-90 minutes
**Best environment**: Quiet, uninterrupted, ideally with a warm beverage
**Mindset**: Curious, non-judgmental, honest

You can do this in one sitting or spread it across several sessions.

## Opening

Take three deep breaths. Arrive in this moment.

The year is ending. Another chapter closes. Before rushing into the next one, let's honor this one — what it gave you, what it taught you, what it took from you.

There are no wrong answers. Only honest ones.
