# Future Self Interview

A guided conversation with who you're becoming.

---

## How to Use This

This interview uses a powerful technique: having a conversation with your future self. You'll write from the perspective of who you'll be 10 years from now — someone who has lived through what's ahead, made the decisions you're facing, and can look back with clarity you don't yet have.

This is not prediction. It's imagination used as a tool for insight.

**Time needed**: 60-90 minutes
**Best environment**: Quiet, reflective, unhurried
**Mindset**: Open, imaginative, honest

The instructions will guide you between your present perspective and your future perspective.

## Setting the Scene

Close your eyes for a moment.

It's 10 years from today. You're sitting somewhere comfortable — somewhere that reflects the life you've built. You're looking back at the person you were (who you are now) with compassion and clarity.

Picture yourself:
- How old are you?
- Where are you?
- What does your body feel like?
- What has your face become?
- What's the quality of your presence?

**Describe where your future self is sitting and what they look like:**
