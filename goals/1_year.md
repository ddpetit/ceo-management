## Instructions

These are your goals for the next 12 months. Not wishes. Not hopes. Goals — things you're committing to pursue with intention.

**Rules for setting one-year goals:**
1. Limit yourself to 3-5 major goals (more than that and you're not prioritizing)
2. Make them specific enough to know when you've achieved them
3. Make them meaningful enough to stay motivated through the year
4. Make them realistic enough that you actually believe you can do them
5. Review them quarterly and update as needed

## Alignment Check

**Would your future self approve of these goals?**
> [YES/NO — WHY?]

## Commitment

I understand that goals are hypotheses, not blood oaths. I commit to pursuing these goals with intention while remaining willing to update them if I learn new information.
