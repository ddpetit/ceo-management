## What This Is

Three years is the sweet spot for vision planning. It's far enough to allow real transformation, close enough to feel tangible, and long enough to achieve things that can't happen in one year.

Your three-year vision isn't a detailed plan. It's a clear picture of where you want to be — specific enough to guide decisions, flexible enough to adapt to what you learn along the way.

## The Date
