# Ten-Year Vision

## What This Is

Ten years is long enough for profound transformation. In ten years, you can:
- Master a new skill from scratch
- Build significant wealth
- Raise a child through childhood
- Build and sell a company
- Completely reinvent yourself

The purpose of a 10-year vision is not prediction — no one can predict ten years out. It's direction. It's the star you navigate by, not the destination you program into GPS.

## The Exercise

**Imagine it's ten years from today.**

Close your eyes. You're [YOUR AGE + 10] years old. You've lived a full decade of life since this moment. Take a breath.

- What does the morning look like?
- Where are you waking up?
- Who is next to you?
- What does your body feel like?
- What are you looking forward to today?
- What have you become?
