# Memory

Your personal pattern recognition system.

---

## What This Is

This document is your long-term memory. It stores:
- Patterns you've noticed across years
- Insights you don't want to forget
- Lessons learned that tend to fade
- Self-knowledge that should inform future decisions
- Summaries from past documents you've uploaded

Unlike your reviews (which are time-bound), this document accumulates. It gets richer over time. Reference it when making major decisions, setting goals, or conducting reviews.

---

## How to Use This

1. **Add to it regularly**: After each annual review, after processing past documents, after major realizations
2. **Reference it often**: Before goal-setting, during quarterly reviews, when facing big decisions
3. **Keep it honest**: This is for your benefit — don't sanitize or perform
4. **Let it evolve**: Update entries when patterns change or insights deepen
